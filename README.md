Files related to video PE#48: Stabilizing a Closed-loop DC-DC Converter considering EMI Filter Effect

Available at: https://youtu.be/KF-fkhOez7s

This video is a continuation of previous video PE47. In this video we show how to make the dc-dc converter stable after adding the EMI filter in two ways: i) by redesigning the closed-loop compensator, and ii) by damping the EMI filter and keeping the same compensator. We see that the second solution is better in terms of the dynamic response of the converter. The drawback is that we need to add more components to the EMI filter. Examples and LTspice simulations are shown to illustrate the different ideas.
